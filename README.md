# ExcelProject
I've recently joined a growing company that markets classic and collector cars, motorcycles, and other vehicles to customers around the world. I have been tasked with cleaning data that has been imported from the sales department. The data is in CSV format and needs to be cleaned before I begin with analysis.


Stages taken to clean the data

Stage 1: CSV file saved as an XLSX file?

Stage 2: Widen all columns so that all the data is visible 

Stage 3: Removed all the empty rows

Stage 4: Removed duplicated records

Stage 5: Sort column A

Stage 6: Format the numbers (Column C)

Stage 7: Remove all double-spaces from the data

Stage 8: Combine the two columns into a single column (into Fullname W-Column)

Stage 9: Save the Workbook
